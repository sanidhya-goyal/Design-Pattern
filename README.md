# Design-Pattern

## OO Basics 
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## OO Principles

- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritence.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

## OO Patterns

- Strategy - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them
  interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.


- Observer defines one-to-many dependency between objects so that when 
one object changes state, all it's dependent are notified and updated automatically.
